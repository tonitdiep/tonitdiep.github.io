Module 5 with Flatiron School is here!! After weeks of learning new concepts like components, containers, props and states and necessary sprinkles with fetching API’s --my brain needed a huge and quick refresher on Rails, HTML/CSS, and object-oriented programming--to bring it into the final project.

This final project on React/Redux with API from Rails’ backend calls for a recipe library application serving recipes of the keto and low-carb lifestyle.  Ultimately this app aims to provide accessible recipes’ ideas and options that are multicultural, low-carb and keto.

Organizing the folders and files starting at the parent level of App.js down to the next level of folders (i.e. actions, containers, components, reducers), each held some files within it as well as libraries we will need to import from into the index.js on the parent level with App.js, to access files from actions, containers, components, and reducers folders. --This perspective is major for myself to comprehend the purpose and aim of this project. Coming from completing back-to-back labs and lessons, I am still digesting a lot of concepts and information that I know is a life-long journey of learning. Usually by project build is when I panic a bit. Then I ground myself into building the actual project. And be assessment-ready!

I struggled with how to organize and get my app running on the frontend. Rather than only immediately implementing all the libraries my app needs starting with index.js at the parent level, I started with fetching APIs from the actions into reducers. All the fetch requests for getting deleting and adding recipes, I have stored in the actions side to managing state on the reducers’ end--is what is happening.  My components are like pieces of staged wings to bring the app together with all the nesting between files and folders to create a nicely managed state of information about all the recipes, to adding recipes and deleting them.

Installing Redux’s thunk into the application to make sure our backend data is used on the frontend. Implementing Router from BrowserRouter and Link makes navigating the website soother between imports and having the right libraries added to our package.json files (similar to the Gemfile).

Looking forward to improve my application after this module and from graduation, as practice and reinforcement of concepts in React and Redux.
