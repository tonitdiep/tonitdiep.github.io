Hailing from Los Angeles, California, as a Vietnamese American woman of the transgender experience, a graduate of Sociology from UC, Santa Barbara, and a classically trained ballet dancer, going into software egineering is the perfect balance of creativity, ingenuity, and math.  Interestingly enough, amidst COVID-19, as a New Yorker, this positively affirms my decision to participate in the Software Engineering Cohort, as it is the catalyst, in terms of career change, and cultivation for work-life balance, in regards to health, happiness, and freedom.  Just like communication, language holds power, access, and enterprise; is how I connect with software development. By recognizing patterns and codes in our daily routines, fuels my focus to provide the best skills and services in future projects and collaborations.  With a diverse background in hospitality, as with passions for wellness, fitness, and financial literacy and empowerment, I am committed to shaping the quality of life with inclusion and access in services and products.
